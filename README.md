# Fake News app

*Currently in Development, there are still many features yet to be added*

Built on React Native using Expo. Install Expo onto your system and use "expo start" to run locally. I'll be releasing build versions for iOS and Android once the application is completed. Hopefully, ejecting from Expo won't be too cumbersome.

I'll be releasing some documentation on the app's architecture soon!
